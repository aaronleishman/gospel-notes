            <h1>The Strait And Narrow Path</h1>
            <p>
                Today I have entitled my talk the strait and narrow path. We have heard this phrase in the church a lot.
                There are 7 chapters in the Book Of Mormon and teaches us about the strait and narrow path. one chapter
                in
                the New Testament and one in the doctrine and covenants.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I would like to point out that in every passage of scripture in reference to the Strait and
                narrow
                path the word Strait isn't Spelled S-T-R-A-I-G-H-T like in a straight line but rather spelled
                S-T-R-A-I-T
                which is defined as Strict, Rigorous, Difficult. I like to think of the Strait and Narrow path as a
                steep
                hiking trail leading up to the tall mountain peak.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do we get on strait and narrow path?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>2 Nephi 31: 17-18</b><br>
                <b>17</b> ...For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a
                remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.<br>
                <b>18</b> And then are ye in this strait and narrow path ....
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                In Lehi's dream we learn where the strait and narrow path end...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>1 Nephi 8: 20</b><br>
                <b>20</b> And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the
                tree by
                which I stood; ....
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Earlier in the Lehi's dream the tree is symbolized as the love of God or of Jesus Christ. In Doctrine
                and
                Covenants section 132 we further learn</p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>Doctrine and Covenants 132: 22</b><br>
                <b>22</b> For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation ....
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                So now we know where the path starts and where it ends. So, what do we need to do when we are on this
                path.
                Some Primary answers might include, pray, go to church, read the scriptures. Some youth might answer
                Endure
                to the End.
            </p>
            Today, I hope to give you a few different things to ponder.
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Telestial laws</b> - are like Thou Shalt not kill, Steal, Cheat etc or an Eye for Eye or tooth
                    for
                    tooth....Most Cultures typically adopt these laws into their rule of law
                </li>
                <li> <b>Terrestrial laws</b> - These are the laws or commandments that Jesus taught in his mortal
                    ministry.
                    Such
                    as the two great commandments to love god and love your neighbor.
                </li>
                <li><b>Celestial Laws</b> - these are the 5 laws that we learn in the temple. The law of obedience, the
                    law of
                    Sacrifice, the law of the gospel, the law of Chastity, and the law of consecration. In the temple we
                    learn that we must live these laws by and through covenants. D&C 88:21 teaches us that by living
                    these laws
                    through covenants we will become sanctified and worthy to have a celestial body.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                So before we are baptized we are living the telestial laws. Then when we are baptized we are commanded
                to
                live by the terrestrial laws. Jesus said if ye love me keep my commandments.

                So on the strait and narrow path we are between baptism and exaltation we are living the Terrestrial
                laws
                while learning and transforming ourselves to live the celestial laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone, that knows me knows that I love tools.
                So what are some tools that we are given to help us transverse the strait and narrow path? For one we
                are
                given the gift of the Holy Ghost. And another is that we are promised that we will have the opportunity
                to
                receive a new or changed heart.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <b>Ezekiel 11: 19-20</b><br>
                <b>19</b> And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the
                stony
                heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:<br>
                <b>20</b> That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my
                people, and I will be their God.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The stony heart is symbolic of the selfish desires of the natural man. The new heart of flesh is able to
                be
                filled with God's love.
            </p>
            <p>
                After King Benjamin's address in Mosiah 5:2 the people experienced a change of heart.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>Mosiah 5:2</b> <br>
                <b>2</b>...the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts,
                that we
                have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This mighty change of heart removes all the desire to sin from us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like I said earlier in my talk the strait and narrow path is not easy. It can be very difficult at
                times. In
                Lehi's dream he uses imagery of mist of darkness to illustrate how hard the path can be.
            </p>

            When Joseph and Ben were little we had a family hobby of Geo-caching. People would hide geocaches
            through
            out the national forest where we lived and publish the GPS coordinates on a website along with a short
            note
            on how diffcult it is to find. One partiliuar geocache I can remember very well. This geocache was on
            top of
            mountain. When we go to the trail head and parked our car. I can remember that pulling out my GPS and
            seeing
            the coordinates given were only 1 mile away. I should mention that a GPS calculates distance as the crow
            flies. This journey to find the geocache ended up much longer than one mile with all the switch backs.
            Halfway through the hike I realized that my young kids weren't going to be able to make it to the top.
            As we
            were resting at an unmarked fork in the trail. At this point we had 3 options.
            Turn back and go home and try again in a couple of years when my kids are older.
            Take the easy trail at the fork.
            Or take the steeper trail up the mountain.
