                <b>Jeremiah 31: 31-34</b>
                <br><b>31</b> Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that <span class="u">I will make a new covenant
                    with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</span>
                <br><b>32</b> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them
                by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an
                husband unto them, saith the Lord:
                <br><b>33</b> But <span class="u">this shall be the covenant</span> that I will make with the house of
                Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, <span class="u">I will put my law in their inward parts, and
                    write it in their hearts;</span> and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
                <br><b>34</b> <span class="u">And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his
                    brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest
                    of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
                    more.</span>

                    will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, <span class="u">even as the Lamanites, because of
                        their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy

                    Imagine that: “And they knew it not.” It is not unusual for one to have received the gift and not really know it.
                    I fear this supernal gift is being obscured by programs and activities and schedules and so many meetings. There are so many places to go, so many things to do in this noisy world. We can be too busy to pay attention to the promptings of the Spirit.
