                Brother of Jared's vision is found in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng">
                    Ether chapter 3</a> Below are some of my thoughts.

                Moroni reiterates that the Brother of Jared could no longer be kept without the veil, becuase of his faith.

                    21</b> And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the promise which the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, <span class="u">the Lord could not withhold anything from his sight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil.</span>

                Moroni also mentions that there was many other people that could not be 
                kept from the veil.

               How can we have this same experience? Answer: By exercising fatih and being sanctified in Christ.
