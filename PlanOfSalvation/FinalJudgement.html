                All Gods Children will overcome the first Spiritual Death as part of the Atonement And come back into
                the presents of God. Jesus keeps this promise that everyone will be brought back into Heavenly Fathers
                Presence. But those that don't repent will feel out of place [uncomfortable] and they will leave the presence
                of God and die the second Spiritual death.

                    mankind from the first deathâ€”that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut
                    off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things
                    spiritual.</span>

                <br><b>18</b> Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the

                    and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for
                    they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.</span>

                Another great scripture below. This idea that we will be restored in the same state we were in this life.
                Last line in versus 7. we will be our own judge and can make our own decision where he end up.

                <b>Alma 41: 5-7</b>
                <br><b>5</b> The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his
                desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; <span class="u">for as he has
                    desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night
                    cometh.</span>
                <br><b>6</b> And so it is on the other hand. <span class="u">If he hath repented of his sins, and
                    desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto
                    righteousness.</span>
                <br><b>7</b> These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that
                are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, <span
                    class="u">they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.</span>
